  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/png/
    - assets/images/svg/icons/
    - assets/images/svg/social/
    - assets/images/svg/tabs/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Circular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Circular/Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Circular/Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Circular/Light.ttf
    - family: Caros

        - asset: assets/fonts/Caros/Regular.otf
